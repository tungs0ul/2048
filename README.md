Develop a game using the techniques of your choice. Please do not spend more than 4
hours on the implementation. The game should follow the following rules:
● The board consists of 4 x 4 squares
● Each field is initially randomly initialized with the value 0, 1 or 2
● The player can move the fields using the left, right, up and down cursor keys.
Each square moves one square in the corresponding direction.
● The following rules apply:
○ A square cannot be moved beyond the edge of the playing field.
○ A square cannot move if the square in the corresponding direction is
already taken and does not have the same value.
○ A field can be moved onto another field if both values of the fields are
identical. If this happens, one field is removed and the value of the
other field is doubled.

● After each move, a 1 or 2 is randomly added to a square on the opposite edge
of the move direction.
